# Prelim Group Programming Project Number 2

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of list data structures in various applications. The goal is to illustrate how list data structures can be employed to manage and organize data effectively. Our chosen application for this project is a **prelim.Objects.File Explorer-like Application**.

### Application Example: prelim.Objects.File Explorer

The project simulates a file explorer application that uses nested lists to represent and manage directories and files. This includes:

- **Directories**: Represented as lists containing files and subdirectories.
- **Files**: Managed within directories, supporting hierarchical organization.
- **Subdirectories**: Nested within directories, allowing for multi-level file management.
